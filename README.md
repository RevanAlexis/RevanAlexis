### Hello there 👋
---
I have always thought that systems development is magical, the reason is that you can build anything, all you need is a computer and your imagination 🌈
I’m Full Stack Developer with more than 7 years of experience, I have worked in many kinds of project/industries 🏭, for example: international trade, banks, vehicle insurance, health, and others.
I like to develop each of my projects with the best concepts of software engineering like design patterns, refactoring, clean code, UI/UX, and others 📓
